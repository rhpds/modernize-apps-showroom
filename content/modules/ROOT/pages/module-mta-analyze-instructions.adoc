== 1. Goals of this lab

As part of the digital transformation and cloud adoption initiative of a large organization, the _Development_ and _DevOps_ teams embarked upon a journey to modernize their existing siloed services running on virtual machines.

The goal of this lab is to assess and analyze the current application portfolio and identify potential issues and risks for implementing advanced cloud-native architectures with application modernization.

== 2. Introduction to Migration Toolkit for Applications

To work on the migration of the existing applications in our portfolio we will use the https://developers.redhat.com/products/mta/overview[Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA)^]. _MTA_ will be used to assess, analyze and finally migrate the `Customers` application, currently running on a _Tomcat_ server on a VM.

Open a new browser to access the {mta_url}[MTA Web Console^].

NOTE: For this lab the MTA Web Console is readily available at that URL. In a production-ready environment the console would be secured by Red Hat Single Sign On and require you to log in with valid credentials.

You will see existing application in the inventory such as *Customers*, *Orders*, *Inventory*, and more.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-inventory.png[application inventory]

The user experience in MTA 7 revolves around the **Application Inventory**, allowing organizations to have a holistic view of their application portfolio.

The inventory also offers seamless integration with other tools, like the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/7.0/html/user_interface_guide/assessing-and-analyzing-applications#mta-assessment-changes-700_user-interface-guide[Assessment^] and https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/7.0/html/user_interface_guide/assessing-and-analyzing-applications#analyzing-an-application_user-interface-guide[Analysis^] modules, to surface information about the portfolio at scale.

=== 2.1. Application Profile

As the portfolio goes through the different processes available in the tool, surfaced information will be stored individually in each application profile. That includes metrics such as risk level and effort required to migrate, and precise data about issues that need to be solved and the application's technology stack.

Click on the _Customers_ application. You will see a side drawer with the application profile opens:

image::mta-analyze/mta-inventory-profile.png[inventory]

One of the key challenges when dealing with large portfolios is being able to figure out a way to group applications together and then come up with different migration strategies for each of those groups. A powerful feature that helps with application classification is an extensible tagging model that allows to classify applications in multiple dimensions. MTA comes out of the box with a wide set of curated categories and tags, but users can add as many as they want to model any concept that could be meaningful in the context of their organization and the application landscape.

Click on the _Tags_ tab from the _Application Profile_ and you will see a list of tags associated to the _Customers_ application.

image::mta-analyze/mta-inventory-profile-tags.png[inventory]

Since the _Customers_ application is a Spring application running on top of a Tomcat server, we have added tags that represent the application technology stack, like _Java_, _Tomcat_ and some _Spring_ components. There's also an additional custom tag representing the usage of a custom corporate configuration library. This should be something to be taken into account, as configuration is one of the key concerns when onboarding an application into the Cloud.

=== 2.2. Archetypes

When dealing with applications at scale, a more sophisticated way of grouping applications together might be required to manage large portfolios effectively. **Archetypes** allow exactly that by automatically classifying applications based on their tag taxonomy. At the same time, applications associated with an archetype inherit some of their features such as additional tags or assessment data.

image::mta-analyze/mta-archetypes.png[archetypes]

Click on the _Summer Framework_ archetype to learn more about how archetypes work. This will open the _Archetype Profile_ side drawer that contains important information about the archetype:

image::mta-analyze/mta-archetypes-summer.png[archetypes]

This archetype has been modeled to cover all traditional Spring applications in the organization, so we can centralize their management. Let's discuss the fields we can find in archetypes:

* Applications that match all the criteria tags will get automatically associated to the archetype. In this case, all applications that have the _Spring_, _Spring MVC_ and _Spring Data_ tags will be associated to the _Summer Framework_ archetype. That is the case of our _Customers_ application.
* Archetype tags are the tags that will be inherited by applications just for the fact of being associated to the current archetype. These are a way to store metadata about applications at scale. In this case we have associated a dedicated tag for the framework (_Summer Framework_) and information about the runtime (_Tomcat_).
* Archetypes often refer to corporate architectures or frameworks that are maintained by some department or team inside the organization. Archetypes also allow to document who are relevant stakeholders associated to them. We can see that the _Summer Framework_ is being maintained by Sanaa Cantu, Lena Bentley and Olumide Themba, alongside the IT Management group.

On the _Applications_ section of the _Archetype Profile_ drawer you can see a link that reads "2 applications". Click on it and you will navigate back to the _Application Inventory_ with preapplied filters to display all applications associated with the _Summer Framework_ archetype. Clicking on the Customers application reveals that it has been associated to the _Summer Framework_ archetype in the _Archetypes_ section from the _Application Profile_.

image::mta-analyze/mta-archetypes-inventory-customers.png[inventory]

Given the association, the application should have inherited the Archetype tags from the Summer Framework archetype. Click on the _Tags_ tab from the _Application Profile_ and filter by Archetype. You should see the tags _Summer Framework_ and _Tomcat_.

image::mta-analyze/mta-archetypes-inventory-customers-tags.png[inventory]

=== 2.3. Controls

*Controls* are a collection of entities that are used to surface information about applications in the inventory. They comprise _business services_, _stakeholders_, _stakeholder groups_, _job functions_, _tag types_, and _tags_.

These controls provide useful metadata about the relationships between applications and their business stakeholders, and can be used to optimize a modernization plan across a portfolio.

==== 2.3.1 Stakeholders

Go to `Controls` on the left menu and you will see existing _Stakeholders_ such as *Borja Cavan* and *Brendon Hayes*.

image::mta-analyze/mta-control-stakeholder.png[stakeholders]

You can also find the existing _Stakeholder groups_ such as *IT Management* and *Retail Management*. You can think of _Stakeholder groups_ as the different teams that support the application landscape in any way inside the organization.

image::mta-analyze/mta-stakeholder-groups.png[stakeholder-groups]

==== 2.3.2 Business services

The simplest way to classify applications is through business services that represent the different business verticals or divisions that an organization might have.

Go to `Controls` on the left menu and click on _Business services_ tab. You will see existing _business services_ such as *Finance and HR* and *Retail*.

image::mta-analyze/mta-control-business-service.png[business service]


== 3. Assessing the Summer Framework archetype

The **Assessment module** provides a high level overview of a given application or archetype through the usage of questionnaires. The tool ships with a _Containerization_ questionnaire out of the box, with more curated questionnaires coming up in subsequent releases. The _Containerization_ questionnaire aims to determine the suitability for containerization for each application. It covers all the different areas of the *application landscape*, including the *technology*, *application lifecycle management*, and *operations*. This questionnaire allow the tool to identify and present potential risks that might prevent an application from running in containers or would require extra steps to mitigate the risk.

=== 3.1. Enabling the Containerization questionnaire

All questionnaires are disabled by default on a brand new *MTA* install to allow users to define which questionnaires should be answered by the user to consider an application as _assessed_. **MTA 7** now includes https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/7.0/html-single/user_interface_guide/index#mta-custom-questionnaire_user-interface-guide[the possibility of authoring custom questionnaires by using a YAML syntax^], but we will stick to the default _Containerization_ questionnaire for this exercise.

Click on the perspective selector on the left menu and select _Administration_. Once the perspective shifts, click on _Assessment Questionnaires_.

image::mta-analyze/mta-questionnaires.png[questionnaires]

This table shows you the list of available questionnaires, with information about number of questions and the different thresholds for all risk levels. The _Legacy Pathfinder_ questionnaire contains the containerization questions we are looking for, so click on the switch from the _Required_ column to enable it.

image::mta-analyze/mta-questionnaires-enabled.png[questionnaires]

This means that, for applications on this MTA instance to be considered as _assessed_, only the _Legacy Pathfinder_ (AKA _Containerization_) questionnaire has to be answered at either application or archetype level.

Click on the perspective selector and select _Migration_ to get back to the _Application Inventory_

image::mta-analyze/mta-intentory-assessed.png[questionnaires]

You will notice that several applications, including our _Customers_ application, now appear to have they assessments completed. This is because some applications were already assessed in this MTA instance.

=== 3.2. Completing the assessment for the Summer Framework archetype

As we were discussing before, one stakeholder team has already assessed the _Summer Framework_ archetype to identify technical problems. However, they couldn't answer the configuration model questions during the first assessment. So they just left the answer as `Unknown` at that time.

Today, you'll run the *second* assessment to choose the proper answer in the `cross-cutting concerns` section for the _Summer Framework_ archetype.

Click on the _Archetypes_ option in the left menu, and then click on the kebab menu (the three vertical dots) for the _Summer Framework_ archetype and select the _Assess_ option.

image::mta-analyze/mta-assessment-summer.png[archetypes]

The system will navigate to a view with a list of the available questionnaires for the _Summer Framework_ archetype. Since the assessment was already done, you will get the options to either _Retake_ the questionnaire or view the previous results.

image::mta-analyze/mta-assessment-summer-options.png[assessment]

Click on _Retake_.

You can think of an questionnaire as the script for having a meaningful conversation. As that conversation will potentially involve multiple stakeholders, it is important to document them in case it is necessary to reach out later to ask for clarifications.

image::mta-analyze/mta-assessment-stakeholders.png[assessment]

You can see that Brendon Hayes, Dante Leblanc and Hanna Miriam were involved in this conversation, as well as the IT Management team. Click on `Next` to begin with the questionnaire.

[NOTE]
====
Review the former answers in the initial assessment for each section such as `Details`, `Dependencies`, and `Observability`. You don't need to change any answers but keep clicking on `Next` button until you get into the `Application cross-cutting concerns` section.
====

image::mta-analyze/mta-assessment-app-details.png[app-details]

Once you arrive to the _Application cross-cutting concerns_ section, choose the following answer for the *How is the application configured?* question. The team finally figured out that applications from the _Summer Framework_ archetype currently use multiple configuration files in different folders/directories, so answer accordingly:

* *Question* - How is the application configured?
* *Answer* - `Multiple configuration files in multiple file system locations`

image::mta-analyze/mta-assessment-app-cross-cutting-concerns.png[app-cross-cutting-concerns]

Click on `Save and review`.

=== 3.3. Application Review

You will be presented with the review screen. It allows you to find out which risks were identified during the assessment and decide which migration strategy to follow based those risks.

image::mta-analyze/mta-review.png[review]

In our assessment, MTA found some medium and high risks, we can take a look at them by scrolling down to the list of risks.The _Summer Framework_ archetype uses a static (fixed) discovery mechanism that is not cloud-friendly, which makes sense since it comes from a classic platform and accesses a database through a *static IP*.

As stated before, the archetype also uses a custom configuration library that happens to load configuration from multiple paths on the filesystem. That is definitely an antippattern for cloud deployments, so we will need to find where that library is used in associated applications and replace it with a more cloud friendly approach.

image::mta-analyze/mta-review-risks.png[review-risks]

Now that we know that there will be some changes required in the source code to adapt applications associated to this archetype, we can decide that the strategy will be `Refactor`.

We believe that only the configuration library needs to be replaced, so we would expect the effort required to be `Small`.

* Proposed action: `Refactor`
* Effort estimate: `Small`

Since the _Summer Framework_ archetype is used to build critical applications for the business, we're going to set the criticality to `10` and priority to `9`.

* Business criticality: `10`
* Work priority: `9`

Click on `Submit Review`.

image::mta-analyze/mta-submit-review.png[submit-review]

As discussed before, applications associated to an archetype will inherit some of its properties, **including the assessment and the review**. Click on the _Application Inventory_ option in the left menu, then click on the _Customers_ application. On the _Archetypes_ section from the _Application Profile_ you can see that the associated archetype (_Summer Framework_) appears to be both assessed and reviewed. The _Customers_ application also has the _Completed_ status on its _Assessment_ and _Review_ columns.

image::mta-analyze/mta-complete-review.png[complete-review]

Now click on the _Review_ tab from the _Application Profile_. As you can see, the values we assigned in the review for the _Summer Framework_ archetype have been inherited by the _Customers_ application.

image::mta-analyze/mta-complete-review-values.png[complete-review]

To see an aggregated view of assessment data across the entire portfolio, go to the `Report` option on the left menu.

image::mta-analyze/mta-report-review.png[report-review]

*Congratulations!* You have now successfully begun the modernization process by assessing the _Summer Framework_ archetype, and you identified issues and risks that will need to be considered in the next step: application analysis and code modification as part of modernization.

Read more about use cases and migration paths at https://developers.redhat.com/products/mta/use-cases[Migration Toolkit for Applications^].

== 4. Analyzing the Customers application

MTA includes an analysis engine capable of static code analysis against both source code and binaries. The _Analysis Module_ provides insights on the dependencies and technology stack of applications, aside from identifying potential issues that might prevent an application from running on a target platform.

As you have realized in the previous *assessment* exercise, you need to analyze the legacy applications in terms of identifying the actual lines of code for the modernization issues as well as estimating time and effort for the modernization project.

The goal of this exercise is to analyze the _Customers_ application by scanning its source code using the _Analysis Module_ in MTA. Then you'll review the analysis report and get started with the actual code modification.

MTA _Analysis_ is used by organizations for:

* Planning and work estimation.
* Identifying migration issues and providing solutions.
* Detailed reporting.

And has several capabilities such as:

* Built-in rules and migration paths.
* Rule extensibility and customization.
* Ability to analyze source code or application archives.

Read more about it in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/7.0/html-single/introduction_to_the_migration_toolkit_for_applications/index#new-mta-features_getting-started-guide[MTA Features]

=== 4.1. Analyze Customers Application using MTA

First, you need to configure *Git repositories* to refer to your link:{gitea_console_url}/{gitea_user}/modern-app-dev[Gitea repository^] when you analyze your inventory and applications using MTA.

In the *Administration* perspective, select *Repositories > Git*. `Toggle` the *Consume insecure Git repositories* switch to the right.

image::mta-analyze/mta-admin-git.png[admin git]

[NOTE]
====
You can also log in to the Gitea repository with the following credentials.

* Username - `{gitea_user}`
* Password - `{gitea_password}`
====

Go back to the `Application inventory` page in the *Migration* perspective. Click on pencil (edit) icon for the `Customers` application.

Update application with the following source code information.

* Repository type - `Git`
* Source Repository - `{gitea_console_url}/{gitea_user}/modern-app-dev.git`
* Branch - `mta-lab`
* Root path - `customers-tomcat-legacy`

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-update-git.png[application-update-git]

Click on `Save`. Your application is now updated and pointing to the Gitea repository from your cluster.

After the changes have been saved, you will notice that the left icon on the application row from the inventory table has changed. When MTA has enough information about where the source or binaries for an application are stored, it attempts to run discovery to learn more about the language and the technology stack used to build the application. If you hover over the icon, you will see the current status of the discovery tasks.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-discovery.png[application-discovery]

Discovery shouldn't take more than a couple minutes for the Customers application. Wait until it finishes and then click on the _Tags_ tab from the _Application Profile_ and then click on the `Source` filter under _Filter by_ and select _Language-discovery_ and _Tech-discovery_ to see the tags that were automatically added by discovery.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-discovery-tags.png[application-discovery]

Let's now continue with the analysis of our application. Select the `Customers` application with the selector checkbox on the left of the application row. The `Analyze` button on the table header will become enabled, so click on it now.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis.png[application-analysis]

=== 4.2. Analysis mode

Select `Source code` in Analysis mode popup. This will automatically retrieve the source code for the `Customers` application from the repository you specified before and use it for analysis.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-mode.png[Analysis mode]

Click on `Next`.

==== 4.3. Set targets

You will now be presented with options for transformation targets. Here we will select several targets based on the technologies we are moving to:

We want to deploy our application on OpenShift, so we would select the Containerization path. Also, to make sure we can use the supported OpenJDK images without surprises, we select the OracleJDK to OpenJDK path as well. Finally, since we are moving towards linux containers, it makes sense to do a sanity check to avoid any Windows paths that might remain on the code from previous iterations.

Click on `Containerization`, `Linux`, and `OracleJDK to OpenJDK` as the targets.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-targets.png[Analysis targets]

Click on `Next`.

==== 4.4. Scope

Users can stick to the application and its internals dependencies only or force the analysis of all libraries, including known Open Source Libraries. Advanced users that have interest only for certain packages can specify them directly as well. For our case, we will stick with the first option.

Select `Application and internal dependencies only` and click on `Next`.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-scope.png[Analysis scope]

=== 4.5. Custom rules

MTA uses an extensible rules engine that looks for antipatterns in order to find what should be changed for the application to run in the target platform. In order to remove the problematic configuration library, we developed a custom rule that looks for any usage of the library and suggests the changes to be performed to replace it with a more Cloud Friendly alternative. To use the rule, we only have to either upload the file containing it or point to a repository during this step of the configuration.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-custom-rules.png[Custom rules]

Custom rules can be developed with a very simple YAML syntax and used as part of the analysis. We've provided some custom rules which will detect the usage of a specific library that we know has been used at the organization in the past and make suggestions for changes to be performed to remove it.

Select `Repository` tab to refer to a custom ruleset in the *customrules* directory of your Gitea repository.

Key in the following information in the repository page.

* Repository type - `Git`
* Source Repository - `{gitea_console_url}/{gitea_user}/modern-app-dev.git`
* Branch - `mta-lab`
* Root path - `customrules`
* Associated credentials - `None`

[NOTE]
====
In case you don't see `None` in the `Associated credentials`, please leave it blank since the field is not mandatory.
====

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-custom-rules-add-repo.png[add-repository-customrules]

Click on `Next`.

=== 4.6. Advanced options and execution

Next, you will be presented with options to fine tune the analysis. For now we will stick with the default options.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-advanced.png[Advanced]

Click on `Next`.

Lastly, we are presented with a summary of the configuration for our analysis.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-review.png[Review]

Click on `Run`. This will get the analysis on the `Scheduled` status while the MTA tasking system requests OpenShift for resources to allocate the analysis pod. MTA fully leverages the resource management capabilities of OpenShift to scale the analysis based on the available resources on the project in which it has been deployed. Individual analysis pods for each application are be created (one in our case), and the analysis runs as soon as there are available resources.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-scheduled.png[Analysis scheduled]

[NOTE]
====
The analysis may take a few minutes to start as it must pull container images for the analyzer engine before executing.
====

Once the image is pulled and the analyzer pod is running, the analysis will change its status to `In Progress`. The application source code is now being analyzed, which could take some additional minutes depending on the workload on the cluster.  When the analysis finishes, the status will change to `Completed`.


== 5. Understanding the analysis results

Application analysis provides insights on several aspects of the application itself, that can be accessed through its _Application Profile_. Once the analysis is finished (the `Completed` status can be seen in the _Analysis_ column), click on the `Customers` application to open its _Application Profile_.

=== 5.1. Effort

MTA helps you determine the effort required to migrate a certain application by aggregating the individual effort for each issue occurrence found in the source code. Effort is expressed in Story Points, which are an abstract metric commonly used in Agile software development to estimate the relative level of effort needed to implement a feature or change. Migration Toolkit for Application uses story points to express the level of effort needed to migrate particular application constructs, and the application as a whole. There is not a direct translation between story points and work hours, since each organization has different teams and skills, but they provide a comparative way to understand how complex migrating an application can be. The level of effort will vary greatly depending on the size and complexity of the application(s) to migrate. Once an application has been analyzed, the `Effort` metric will be available as a column in the _Application Inventory_ table and in the application profile.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-effort.png[Effort]


=== 5.2. Technology stack

The first and most straightforward insight the analysis outputs would be identifying the technology stack and associating it to the _Application Profile_ as tags, so that information can later be leveraged to automatically assign archetypes across the portfolio.

Click on the _Tags_ tab to browse the tags associated with the `Customers` application. Notice that this tab now shows way more tags than what we saw when we first browsed them when we were introducing the _Application Profile_ concept. These tags have been automatically applied by the analyzer engine based on the technologies it was able to identify while running the analysis. To see which tags were specifically applied by the analyzer, click on the `Source` filter under _Filter by_ and select `Analysis`.

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-tags.png[Analysis tags]


=== 5.3. Issues

In the MTA jargon, `Issues` are antipatterns found in applications that might prevent them from running in a given platform. As with Dependencies, MTA allows browsing issues individually on a per application basis or globally at portfolio level, allowing users to focus on certain applications or identify trends across the entire application portfolio respectively. A shortcut to the issues of a given application can be found on the details tab from the _Application Profile_.

Click on the `Customers` application to open the _Application Profile_ and then click on `Issues`. That will navigate to the `Single Application` tab from the `Issues` view with filters preapplied to display all the issues from the `Customers` application:

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-issues.png[Issues]

The list includes direct access the usage of hardcoded IPs, which is aligned with our findings during the assessment. It appears that the custom rule we specified before got triggered as well. If we click on an issue, we get more information about it, including code snippets, links to external information and the list of affected files.

Expand the `Hardcoded IP Address` row from the `Issues` table and click on `Affected Files`:

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-issues-ip-files.png[Issues]

This gives you the list of affected files for this problem. Click on the first one and a modal window will open with further details, including the exact code snippet in which the issue was found, alongside an explanation of how to solve it:

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-issues-ip-snippet.png[Issues]

The analyzer has indeed found a static IP, but this comes from a properties file, so shouldn't be considered that much of an issue if for example the database, which is the asset being accessed here, remains outside of OpenShift in its original location. Close the modal window and the `Affected Files` drawer.

Now expand the `Legacy configuration with io.konveyor.demo.config.ApplicationConfiguration` row. This corresponds to the triggering of the custom rule that looks for the usage of the custom corporate configuration library. Click on `View affected files` to learn more about how widespread the usage of that library is:

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-issues-config-files.png[Issues]

Only the `PersistenceConfig` class seems to be affected by the issue. Click on it to know more:

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-issues-config-snippet1.png[Issues]

Looks like two occurrences of the same issue have been found in the file, click on the incident tabs from the modal window to alternate between them:

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-issues-config-snippet2.png[Issues]

This means that the analyzer has found the `ApplicationConfiguration` class from the custom configuration library being used twice in the `PersistenceConfig` class. We'll have to replace that with something more standard, following the guidelines provided by the hints in the usage. This is something we'll tackle in the next module. For the moment close all modals and head back to the _Application Inventory_ view.

=== 5.4. Dependencies

The analysis in MTA also gathers detailed information about dependencies used by applications in the portfolio. To get a list of the dependencies for the `Customers` application, open its _Application Profile_ and click on the `Dependencies` link from the `Details` tab. This will navigate to the `Dependencies` view with the filter for the `Customers` application preapplied:

image::mta-analyze/mta-application-analysis-dependencies.png[Dependencies]

Clicking on a dependency will provide additional details about how its relationship with each application in the portfolio that relies on it, including:

* Version of the dependency, with a link to Maven Central.
* Management relationship, indicating whether the dependency is managed by a dependency manager like Maven or it was simply found embedded in a binary.
* Relationship, which defines whether the dependency is direct or transitive.

== Summary

You have now successfully analyzed the legacy application to gather insight about technologies, dependencies and potential issues that need to be addressed for the application to run in OpenShift.
