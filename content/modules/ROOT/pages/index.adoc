`Migration Toolkit for Applications` is the ultimate Open Source toolkit to help organizations safely migrate and modernize their application portfolio to leverage OpenShift and other Red Hat technologies, providing differential value on each stage of the adoption process.

The goal for the tool is to provide as much insight as possible for the adoption leads to make informed decisions and give migrators guidance and some degree of automation for the adaptations that might be required on applications.

The rationale behind the approach of the tools is very straightforward: reduce risks and make the migration and modernization process measurable and predictable.

In this lab we will learn the essentials of MTA by assessing and analyzing the current application portfolio from an organization and identifying potential issues and risks for implementing advanced cloud-native architectures with application modernization.
